# Course Credits & Class Meeting Times 
This class meets on Wednesday from 1:00 – 2:50 pm for interactive lectures, and combines approximately 60 hours of instruction and work outside of class for 2 credits.

# Location
Wilkinson 203 (we will assess the suitability of the class on the first day)

Class GitHub Repository: https://github.com/JessCG/OC_ProgrammingGroup 

# Prerequisites
None

# Catalog Course Description
In the first half of the class, students will be introduced to computing resources as they apply for marine research, such as Python, Jupyter Hub & xarray; GitHub, version control & personal academic websites; NetCDF file format and metadata; and computing servers. In the second half of the class, students will be guided through using these tools to accomplish a goal tailored to their research. Timing of the class will be discussed with enrolled students during the first week of classes.

# Student Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will:

- Be able to use Terminal, GitHub, Jupyter Lab and xarray, as desired, to enhance their research
- Have achieved a self-defined research objective, which might have required adjustments 
- Have developed research independence and confidence in exploring unknown programming tools
- Have developed a network of peers for future accountability and assistance

# Learning Resources
There is no required text that you need to buy for this course; however, we will take advantage of free resources available online.

# Evaluation of Student Performance
The class will be evaluated as satisfactory/unsatisfactory only. Students who show up and present a final project that met an objective approved by the instructor will be awarded a satisfactory grade. Students can miss 2 classes no questions asked and still receive a satisfactory grade. Missing more than 2 classes will require noticing the instructor.

# Statement Regarding Students with Disabilities
Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and approved by Disability Access Services (DAS). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained approval please contact DAS immediately at 541-737-4098 or at http://ds.oregonstate.edu. DAS notifies students and faculty members of approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of those accommodations. While not required, students and faculty members are encouraged to discuss details of the implementation of individual accommodations.

# Student Bill of Rights
OSU has twelve established student rights. They include due process in all university disciplinary processes, an equal opportunity to learn, and grading in accordance with the course syllabus: https://asosu.oregonstate.edu/advocacy/rights

# Reach Out for Success
University students encounter setbacks from time to time. If you encounter difficulties and need assistance, it’s important to reach out. Consider discussing the situation with an instructor or academic advisor. Learn about resources that assist with wellness and academic success at oregonstate.edu/ReachOut. If you are in immediate crisis, please contact the Crisis Text Line by texting OREGON to 741-741 or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255)

# Student Learning Experience Survey
During Fall, Winter, and Spring term the online Student Learning Experience surveys open to students the Wednesday of week 9 and close the Sunday before Finals Week. Students will receive notification, instructions, and the link through their ONID email. They may also log into the survey via MyOregonState or directly at https://beav.es/Student-Learning-Survey. Survey results are extremely important and are used to help improve courses and the learning experience of future students. Responses are anonymous (unless a student chooses to “sign” their comments, agreeing to relinquish anonymity of written comments) and are not available to instructors until after grades have been posted. The results of scaled questions and signed comments go to both the instructor and their unit head/supervisor. Anonymous (unsigned) comments go to the instructor only.
