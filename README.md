# OC_ProgrammingGroup
Contains the course material for OC 599/649 - Computing &amp; Marine Sciences

## Hello World!

## Class objectives
The goal of this class is to introduce students to a range of programming tools available for research that can increase productivity and hireability. This approach can feel overwhelming, but remember that no one is expected to learn all of these new tools at once. 

You are encouraged to view this introduction as an exhibit, and choose to focus on one or a few tools that are most helpful to you at this time. The rest of the notes can be referenced later, if and when they become useful for your research.

To pass the class, you only need to show weekly progress on a programming goal related to your research, as defined by you. This class is meant to be a research accelerator, so we will shape it based on your needs.

## Notes
The `Notes` directory contains notebooks, instructions, and links to reproduce the material covered in class. This material will be provided ahead of time so you can come to class prepared. 

For some classes, software will need to be installed ahead of class. You should try your best to do so prior to class, but if you run into issues, we will troubleshoot them as a group.
